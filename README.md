# GamingWorkshopProject

This gaming application was created while watching the gaming workshop conducted by Purdue Hackers Club in the first semester at Purdue University. This is a intro-level gaming project that provides an introduction to networking of an io game with a chat demo in Socket.IO. This project covers basics of a real io game with
basic rendering, netcode, and movement.
